|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1              | Flashcards list not updating after deleting a flashcard    | Flashcard was deleted on backend but not removed from frontend state | Updated local state after successful deletion to immediately reflect UI changes |
| 2              | Navigation bar did not update after login/logout           | Token and username changes were not triggering rerender  | Used `localStorage` correctly and adjusted component to rerender on auth state changes |
| 3              | Form error messages were not displayed on failed submissions | Form was catching errors but not rendering them properly | Added logic to map backend errors into a list and render dynamically in the UI |
| 4              | Flashcards text overflowed on small devices                | No responsive styling was applied to flashcard elements  | Added media queries to adjust font size, padding, and layout on smaller screens |
| 5              | Review flashcards component crashed if no cards were available | No check if array was empty before accessing card properties | Added conditional rendering and fallback messages when no flashcards were available |
